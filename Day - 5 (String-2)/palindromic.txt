PALINDROMIC STRING PROBLEMS – PRACTICE LIST
==========================================

Core Idea: Expand Around Center / Palindrome Recognition


1) 647. Palindromic Substrings
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/
Idea:
Count all palindromic substrings by expanding around every possible center.
Consider both odd-length and even-length palindromes.


2) 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/
Idea:
For each index (and between indices), expand outward while characters match.
Track the maximum length palindrome found.


--------------------------------------------------

Palindrome Partitioning (Backtracking + DP)


3) 131. Palindrome Partitioning
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/
Idea:
Use backtracking to try all partitions.
Only cut when the current substring is a palindrome.


4) 132. Palindrome Partitioning II
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/
Idea:
Use DP to compute minimum cuts needed so every substring is a palindrome.
Precompute palindrome table for optimization.


5) 1745. Palindrome Partitioning IV
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-iv/
Idea:
Check if string can be split into exactly three non-empty palindromic substrings.
Use DP or backtracking with palindrome checking.


--------------------------------------------------

DP on Palindromes


6) 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/
Idea:
Use DP on string indices.
If characters match, extend length; otherwise take max of skipping one side.


7) 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-different-palindromic-subsequences/
Idea:
Advanced DP problem.
Count distinct palindromic subsequences using character boundaries.


--------------------------------------------------

Advanced / Optimization Problems


8) 214. Shortest Palindrome
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/
Idea:
Find longest palindromic prefix.
Add remaining characters in front to make the string a palindrome.


9) 336. Palindrome Pairs
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/
Idea:
For each word, split into prefix and suffix.
Check if one part is palindrome and the other exists reversed.


10) 1960. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-substrings/
Idea:
Precompute longest palindrome ending at each index.
Choose two non-overlapping palindromes with maximum product.


--------------------------------------------------

Easy Warm-Up Palindrome Problems


11) 125. Valid Palindrome
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/
Idea:
Two-pointer approach ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.


12) 680. Valid Palindrome II
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/
Idea:
Two pointers with at most one allowed deletion when mismatch occurs.


13) 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-palindromic-string-in-the-array/
Idea:
Iterate through array and check each string for palindrome property.
